# ðŸ§© zk Puzzle Game

This is a minimal zero-knowledge puzzle game written in Rust. It simulates ZK proof verification logic and is structured for future integration with Succinct's SP1 prover.

## ðŸ§  Idea

- Public input: `"rust"`
- Secret solution: `"zk"`
- Proof is simulated via a placeholder verifier.
- When real SP1 integration is added, this can be extended to use actual ZK proofs.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dangbana01/zk_puzzle_game.git
cd zk_puzzle_game
cargo run
